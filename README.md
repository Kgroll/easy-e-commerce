  ## Installation

  To install this application you will first need to clone the code from my GitHub account and paste it into your command-line. You will then need to download node.js, npm express, sequelize, mysql2 and dotenv, as these are crucial to the program, following the promots regarding installation. Once everything is installed,  press the windows button and R  to open the mysql Command Line Interface. Once there you will need to enter the root address for the start by entering program (eg: cd desktop/easy-e-commerce). When in the right location you need to start mysql by entering mysql -u root -p and entering your password. Now you are in mysql! You can now follow the video instructions to display the tables. 

  ## Features
